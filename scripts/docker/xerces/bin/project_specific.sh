# This file is an adaptation layer for CodeCompass framework.
# It is sourced to the bash scripts of the toolset and provides an API.
# When you plan to adapt your project to the framework, these functions
# should be ported.
# The toolset binaries and this file should be placed in the same directory.
# The project specific helper scripts can be installed in other place.

# Installing project specific things.
# Parameters:
# 1 - Directory where the binaries of the toolset was installed.
#
# 2 - Directory where the configuration files are placed.
#
# 3 - Directory where the project specific files are placed.
#
# Xerces:
# The build directory is set up on the host, that is mounted by the Docker.

# 1 - Directory where the database should be created.

# Return:
# Full name of the compilation database file.

# Return:
# 0 if the project needs logging phase before parsing phase to produce compilation
# database on demand.
# 1 - When there is  compilation database that reachable by the framework at the
# moment of the parsing phase.
#
# Sometimes the logging phase is not necessary, for example the project has got

# Parameters:
# 1 - Directory where the binaries of the toolset was installed.
# 2 - Directory where the database should be created.

# Return:
# Full name of the pre-processed/filtered compilation database file.
#
# Sometimes the compilation database contains unnecessary compile commands or
# requires modifications that allows the clang compiler to run well.
# This hook allows project specific editing before parsing phase.
